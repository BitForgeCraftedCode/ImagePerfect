## 🔍 User Guide

The best way to get started is to run the app and explore. But here’s a guided overview of the core features.

### 📂 Importing the Library Structure

**To start building your library:**

- **Library Management ➡️ Pick Library Folder** 
- Select the root folder that contains all your image folders
- Image Perfect will scan the folder structure (but not import images yet)
	+ If you have a large library this will take some time to import your folder structure
	
> 💡 **Tip**: Image Perfect works best when your photo collection is already organized into meaningful folders. 
Avoid dumping thousands of images into a single folder.
	

### 🗑️ Deleting the Library

- **Library Management ➡️ Delete Library**

This removes the MySQL database but **does not delete your image files** from the file system.
	
### ➕ Adding New Folders 

You can add additional folders to your library after initial import.

- **File Management ➡️ Add New Folders**
- Select one or more new folders from the file system 
- The app will skip any folder that has already been imported

> 📌 **Note Known issue**: folders imported containing only ZIP files cannot be opened. 
So ensure your new folders contain only images jpg, png, gif etc.

### Unzipping files
- **File Management  ➡️ Pick Folders With Zips To Extract**
- Select one or more folders containing zip files from the file system
- The app will extract all images from the zip files and put them in a folder with the same name as the zip file name.
- You can then add the new folders to your database
	
### 🖼️ Importing Images & Scanning Metadata

**Importing images** loads file paths into the MySQL database.  
**Scanning metadata** reads tags and ratings from image files (e.g., written by Shotwell) and stores them in the database.

> 📌 **Note**: Metadata is *not* scanned and images are *not* imported during the initial library import for speed.

#### 📂 Per-Folder Import/Scan

- Click **Import Images** button on a specific folder to load all image paths into the database
- Click **Scan Images for Metadata** button on a specific folder to extract tags/ratings from image files.

> 📌 **Note**: You have to **Import Images** first before the scan metadata button appears.

#### 📦 Bulk Import & Scan

- **File ➡️ Import and Scan** to open the bulk toolbar
- Use these buttons on the current page of folders:

| Button                                 | Description                        |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Import All Folders On Current Page** | Quickly imports all images for folders on the page |
| **Scan All Folders On Current Page**   | Scans all images for metadata (Takes longer) |
| **Add Cover Image On Current Page**    | Picks a random image as a folder cover (must import images first) |
| **Get Folder Text**                    | Populates folder description with the contents of a text file in the folders. Intended to be used with "Back Up Folder Text" |
| **Back Up Folder Text**                | Backs up the folder description to a text file in the folders. Intended as a good secondary back up of the folder description. |

> ⏱️ **Performance Tip**:  
> Scanning metadata can be time-consuming on large pages. Use a folder pagination size of 40–60 for best balance.  
> A page size of 100 folders may take several minutes depending on number of images, image resolution, and computer specs.

#### 🔍 Filter-Based Bulk Actions

- **Filters ➡️ Folder Filters ➡️ Get Folders With Images Not Imported**
- **Filters ➡️ Folder Filters ➡️ Get Folders With Metadata Not Scanned**
- **Filters ➡️ Folder Filters ➡️ Get Folders Without Covers**

Optionally check **"Filter in Current Directory"**, then run the corresponding import/scan or add cover image button 
from the **Import and Scan** toolbar.

### 🧭 Navigation 

Image Perfect was designed to mirror the file system so navigation will mostly be intuitive. However, there are a lot of buttons within the app and the pagination feature adds some complexity so getting used to navigating may take a bit. Navigation is done with a combination of on folder and on image buttons as well as two, always visible, toolbars.

#### Hot Keys

- Ctrl + L (Loads the saved directory)
- Ctrl + B (Goes back one directory)
- Ctrl + R (Reloads the current directory)
- Ctrl + O (Open the directory in OS file explorer)
- Ctrl + S (Saves the current directory)
- Up Arrow will scroll up
- Down Arrow Will scroll down
- Right Arrow will go to Next Page 
- Left Arrow will go the Previous Page
