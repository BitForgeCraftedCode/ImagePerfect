## ⚠️ Important Note On Metadata
> Currently, ImagePerfect **only officially supports reading tags and ratings written by Shotwell**, and only if you had Shotwell write that data into the image files themselves (via its “Write Metadata to Files” option).
>
> If that’s your setup, make sure to **scan the folder for metadata before adding or changing ratings/tags** in ImagePerfect.
>
> ImagePerfect is non-destructive, with the **only exception** being that it writes ratings and tags directly into your image files. Scanning first ensures your existing Shotwell data is loaded correctly and helps avoid accidentally overwriting it.
