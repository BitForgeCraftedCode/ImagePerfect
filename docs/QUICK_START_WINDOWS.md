> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unsigned Installer Notice**
> 
> The current Windows installer is **unsigned**, which may trigger warnings during download or installation.
> To ensure the installer has not been tampered with, please verify its integrity using the SHA-256 hash listed on the [release page](https://github.com/BitForgeCraftedCode/ImagePerfect/releases).
> 
> Example on Windows PowerShell:
> 
> ```powershell
> Get-FileHash ImagePerfectInstaller-v1.0-beta.exe -Algorithm SHA256
> ```
> 
> Compare the output to the hash shown in the release notes. If they match, the installer is safe to run.

>üí° Additional Security Notes:
>
>**Built from Source**: The installer is generated directly from the source code in this repository, so you can inspect the code yourself before running the installer.
>
>**Official Releases Only**: Always download installers from the official GitHub [release page](https://github.com/BitForgeCraftedCode/ImagePerfect/releases) to avoid tampered copies.
